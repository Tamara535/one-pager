      <h2>About the Interactive Coin Flip</h2>
      <p>
        This interactive coin flip website was designed to provide users with an engaging and visually appealing experience. I implemented a realistic coin-flipping animation using CSS and JavaScript to simulate a 3D rotation, creating a dynamic and immersive visual effect. The project includes randomized outcomes, revealing thought-provoking insights for both "Heads" and "Tails" results.
      </p>
      <p>
        I designed a sleek, professional layout with a card-based structure to enhance readability and ensure a balanced, modern UI. Additionally, I incorporated a dark mode feature, enabling users to toggle between light and dark themes seamlessly. The website is fully responsive, with optimized transitions and animations for smooth interaction across different devices.
